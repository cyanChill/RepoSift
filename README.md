# RepoSift

An updated version of a project I've made recently, [GitInspire](https://github.com/cyanChill/GitInspire). This will be made entirely in Next.js for a better user experience when hosting as currently, the backend of GitInspire has coldstarts, which causes the user to have to wait a bit before the application is fully functional. In addition, I'm planning out the styling of the app in Figma compared to what I did prior. I opted to have my app follow a neubrutalism style, which has a bold and simple look.
